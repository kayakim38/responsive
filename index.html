              <span>Nostalgia is back in full force!</span> From oversized text
              to retro illustrations, there are a lot of visual elements that
              are making a comeback in the 2020s. Designers have been
              incorporating graphics inspired by the trends in the late 90s and
              Y2K. In web design, you can certainly expect to see Y2K effects
              dominating the realm for the coming year.<br />Static noise in
              background imagery, neon colors, and matrix-style text are just
              some of the elements you may see becoming popular. Given that
              people react so strongly to nostalgia in design, it’s no surprise
              that Y2K aesthetics are being used in branding more commonly
              now.<br />Such effects can work in business websites for
              marketing, design services, and portfolios as well. If you are
              looking to take inspiration from the web design trend, it’s a good
              idea to keep mobile responsiveness in mind and add only those
              elements that keep the users engaged on every device.

          Claymorphysm, a burgeoning trend in UI design, encapsulates a dynamic
          shift towards more tactile and malleable user interfaces. Drawing
          inspiration from the pliability of clay, this design approach
          introduces fluidity and adaptability, breaking away from the rigid
          structures of traditional interfaces. Elements morph and transform
          seamlessly, offering users a visually engaging and interactive
          experience. The Claymorphysm trend leverages advancements in
          technology to create interfaces that respond to user interactions with
          a natural, intuitive feel, enhancing user engagement and
          satisfaction.<br />This trend is particularly prominent in app design,
          where buttons, icons, and entire layouts undergo subtle
          transformations, giving users a sense of direct manipulation. The
          clay-like quality not only adds a touch of playfulness but also serves
          a functional purpose, guiding users through different states and
          actions. Claymorphysm not only pushes the boundaries of UI design but
          also aligns with the growing demand for more immersive and dynamic
          digital experiences. As designers continue to explore and refine this
          trend, we can anticipate an even more seamless integration of
          clay-like elements into various digital interfaces, providing users
          with a captivating and enjoyable journey through interactive design
          landscapes.

              Dieter Rams famously said that “good design is as little design as
              possible.” Well, maximalism is pretty much in direct opposition to
              that approach. If there was one overarching web design trend that
              was big on the internet in 2023—and will continue to be in
              2024—it’s maximalism.<span
                >Think: loud graphics, dopamine colors, expressive typography,
                and overall a strong visual point of view.</span
              ><br>We keep waiting for maximalism to reach peak market
              saturation, but so far, clients and their consumers can’t seem to
              get enough of the more-is-more approach. It has appeal across
              categories, but especially for the web presence of CPG, F&B and
              emerging brands catering to younger audiences. Consider JKR’s
              super well-received rebrand of mass-market soda Fanta, the playful
              primary colors and chubby, all-caps sans branding of celeb chef
              Molly Baz's website (and new book designed by Playlab Inc., aptly
              called More is More); or Collins’ new take on Disney-owned
              streaming service Freeform.<br>Maximalism has also spawned a
              variety of smaller identifiable sub-trends, including heritage
              revivalism and ‘80s-inspired retro glamor (more on those below),
              showing up in individual site elements as well as entire brand
              worlds. In 2024, maximalism will continue to evolve as it
              saturates the market, and designers will find new stylistic
              expressions of this more-is-more approach to break through
              thenoise and meet the demands of their clients.

            If you are looking to create a website that is ultra-minimalist and
            conveys the necessary information in the first look, then consider
            adding large or oversized text across all sections. Other than the
            main headline above the fold, you can opt for thick and bold
            headings to highlight services, bestselling products, or contact
            information.<br>Plain text with sans serif font styles can add to
            the appeal of the website. You can also say more with less if you
            choose to display information in large and oversized text. It also
            increases the responsiveness of the websites as designers can keep
            the layout minimal and skip large visuals on the pages.<br>This
            web design trend could work well for service-based businesses,
            agencies and SaaS websites. The oversized or large text draws focus
            to the main USP (unique selling point) and how the product can fill
            a gap for the audience.
